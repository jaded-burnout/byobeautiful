If you want to add feature options:
1. Add the CSS for the feature to `src/more-byob.css`.  Remember to scope your
   selectors under `.your-new-class .forum_268`!
2. Add a menu item to `src/popup.html`.  You'll probably just need a fieldset,
   label, and checkbox.
3. If you have any controls other than a lonely checkbox, add code to `src/extras.js`.
4. Open a pull request.
5. Bask!
